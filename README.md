# Fetch-Rewards

In this exercise, I worked with the `receipts.json`, `brands.json`, and `users.json` to create a relational ER Diagram, which can be viewed through the ER Diagram pdf. In the notebook, I loaded the data, transformed the json-format into dataframe, and identified some issues such as missing values and potential outliers. I also included the query question where I wanted to answer a business stakeholder's question in the notebook, as well as the communication email dedicated to help them understand my progress.
